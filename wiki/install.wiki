libMI is a C++ library to calculate the mutual information of a pair of temporal series with bootstrap confidence bands.

= INSTALL = 

libMI depends on the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) and on a modified version the Approximate Nearest Neighbour library (ANN, included in the source download).

To install libMI do the following steps:

==Install the development files for GSL.==

If you use a Debian like system (like Ubuntu), this can be done by installing the packages libgsl0 and libgsl0-dev by your favorite method:

{{{
sudo aptitude install libgsl0-dev libgsl0
}}}

==Install ANN. ==

Make sure you have g++ installed in your system. If you are unsure install the build-essential package:

{{{
sudo aptitude install build-essential
}}}

Enter the created folder:
{{{
cd ann_1.1.1 
}}}

and type:

{{{
make linux-g++
sudo make install
}}}

==Install libMI==

Enter the folder:
{{{
cd libMI
}}}

If you prefer to have libMI as a dynamically linked library do (if you don't care or don't know what this means, just ignore this step):
{{{
mv Makefile MakefileStatic
mv MakefileDyn Makefile
}}}

Compile and install the library:
{{{
make all
sudo make install
}}}

==Test libMI==

Enter the test folder inside libMI folder:
{{{
cd test
}}}

Compile the program test.c:
{{{
make
}}}

Run the test:
{{{
./test
}}}

If it spits some numbers out everything is fine.
